state mangement:
    * store all extensions in one array called extensions (the only source of data)
    * every extension will have a unique id

logic:
    1- implement renderExtensions(): 
        * will take the extensions array as a parameter
        * loop through out the extensions array
            - create li element with it's children
            - append the li into the extensions list
    2- implement toggleExtensionsState(id): 
        * Search for the extension that has the same ID 
        * when found check for isActive prop
            - if true change it to false
            - else change it to true
    3- implement removeExtension(id):
        * Search for the extension that has the same ID
        * when found remove the extension from extensions array
        * call the renderExtensions(array) and pass it the modified extensions array
    4- if show all extensions button is clicked:
        * call the renderExtensions(array) and pass it extensions as a parameter
    5- implement showActiveOrInActiveExensions(condition):
        * create a copy of the extensions array called extensionsCopy
        * extensionsCopy will be filtered from extensions that it's isActive prop == (condition)
        * call the renderExtensions(array) and pass it extensionsCopy as a parameter
    6- implement toggleTheme():
        * the function will be called when toggle theme button is clicked
        * if html classname contains "dark"
            - remove the classname
            - change the icon from sun to moon
        * else  
            - add dark classname to the html element
            - change the icon from moon to sun
